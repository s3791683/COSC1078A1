                        My name is Nicolas R. Papageorgiou, my student no is s3791683 and my email address is s3791683@student.rmit.edu.au.
                        I was born in Australia, however, my background is Greek. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I studied French and German in high school but as a second language I am quite good at speaking Greek. I like to play soccer, and am currently playing for an undefeated 5 aside team. I enjoy playing games such as PUBG, GTA V and CSGO just to name a few.

                        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Ever since the first time I laid my hands on a keyboard and mouse I knew I wanted to learn more about computers. Later, from that moment I managed to select and construct computer parts to build my very own pc which at the time was primarily for gaming. This helped me explore the world of computers and understand their full capability which lead me into my interest for programming. I chose to embark on my IT career at RMIT as I know my full capabilities will be reached through the many course majors which can be completed to have a fulfilling, enjoyable job. I expect to learn the expectations required of me in an actual IT job, depending on what IT related job I choose to pursue.

                            I must have experience in coding and testing JavaScript client applications as well as have history with using REACT. In addition, I must be able to code effectively and efficiently in both HTML and CSS. Qualifications include completion of an undergraduate degree such as a Bachelor of Computer Science or a Bachelor of Software Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My skills include an intermmediate understanding of languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I currently do not have the qualifications as I have not completed my degree yet. I have experience in using visual studio specifically utilizing the Umbraco Framework to build a customer portal for a company called Cold Flow using the language C#.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve these qualifications and skills I will conduct research in the specific languages required for the Job, those being HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will enhance and broaden my skillset by getting hands on familiarity with the languages and how they all interelate to form little projects of my own. Resources such as Youtube will give me clear tutorials on how to go about learning each individual language and stackoverflow.com will be right beside me incase I encounter any difficulties or problems.

                    <header class="sectionHeading">
                        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
                    </header>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The project idea which I have a chosen to undertake will involve the development of a smartphone application. The app will be specifically designed for individuals who want to remember key information from certain areas of study. In which they will be able to create questions and answers to choose from in a test-like format to test their knowledge and too see if they have retained their desired information. The app will incorporate a range of incentives such as a point system to show the individual of their progress, and a range of colourful and inviting visuals to make the app more exciting and favourable above others.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Students are always faced with the task of memorizing key information for content heavy subjects. To ease the pressure and stress of retaining large amounts of information I have proposed the creation of an app that will help to not only remember the preferred information but to make it a fun and easy experience. Students are always faced with the idea of learning information from a 1000 paged textbook, now students will be able to choose what information is necessary to be learnt, which can save time and sleep. Furthermore, regardless of age and complexity of information this app will be purposeful for tertiary, secondary and primary students making it accessible for the wider communities across Australia and the world.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Apps features will include a language translator which will allow individuals from other nationalities to also use the app the way it is intended to. This language translator will be a feature in the settings tab which will be accompanied by the countries Flag if applicable. In addition, the app will include a local database system in which the user can store and access past tests and view their past marks which will indicate to the user their overall improvement. The app will comprise of a start-up menu which will give the user the ability to create/edit tests, access their results and undergo their desired tests. The create/edit tests feature will allow the user to give the Test a “Title” and a desired number of questions and answers. If the user feels they no longer require a specific question they can delete it by accessing the create/edit tests page. The results page will incorporate 5 main features, the percentage from the test, the time in which the user took to complete the test, the users past test results (if any), the points gained from completing the test and the overall grade from that test. The overall grade will determine how many points are awarded to the individual and the amount of points gained will determine progress of the individuals rank. The ranks will be titled with fun names such as rank 1 – Purple Primary Pupil, rank 2 – Slimy Secondary Student and rank 3 – Tired Tertiary Tutor etc. The ranks and their titles can be viewed on the home screen of the App, as well as a small progress bar to indicate the points needed to achieve the next rank. As the user increases with rank it will take more points for the user to reach the next rank. Hence, achieving rank 1 will be easier than achieving rank 15. Once the user wishes to begin the desired test, they will be accompanied by a begin test button which will initiate the timer and a metronome melody, this timer feature will be visible in the bottom right of the app when undergoing a test. Both the timer and melody feature can be deactivated in the settings tab on the front screen, as some users may feel pressured from the sound and visual representation of time loss. Furthermore, the finish test button will automatically take the user to the results page. After the user is satisfied with their results the user will be sent to the front screen which will show their rank and progress bar being updated through a short and exciting animation. The animation will incorporate a visual representation of the individual rank names for example rank 2 (slimy secondary student) will depict a secondary student covered in green gooey slime, rank 3(Tired Tertiary Tutor) will elucidate a tertiary tutor who is sleeping on a book etc. This will give the user an incentive to see all the animations of all the different and unique ranks which can be achieved through the completion of their own studies.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        The hardware needed to create this app will be a computer. I will also need a smartphone to test the app physically. The open source tool I will be using is called Appcelerator. It is used to build, test, connect, and describe the scope of the app that is being built. It favours JavaScript programming. This tool allows me to write one code base which will cover all platforms such as IOS and Android, which will be time efficient. I will be able to build my app in a quick and easy manner to assess user interaction with the UI.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                    <p>
                        To develop my app, I will use online programming forums to troubleshoot and fix any arising issues and I will use YouTube to gain practice to develop my own features using JavaScript code. As I already own both a computer and phone this will make my job far easier as I then require learning the JavaScript language to maximise Appcelerator’s full potential. I will need to learn how to test my app through online tutorials and observe any red flags which may be causing my program to have errors which are detrimental to the app’s functionality and the overall user experience.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        If my project is successful it will ease the burden of study upon students who aren’t engaged with the ‘old school’ mentality of learning (in front of a book with a pen). This app will make students feel as though they are playing a game and that inevitably succeeding in their studies will get them to the next rank in the game and in the next level in their academic careers .This app will boost students confidence in classroom environments as they will be more inclined to answer questions to which they know the right response to. Hence, creating lessons which are more engaging for both the students and the teachers.
